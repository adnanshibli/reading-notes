* Comparison operators — operators that compare values and return true or false. The operators include: >, <, >=, <=, ===, and !==.
* Logical operators — operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output. The operators include: &&, ||, and !.
# COMPARISON OPERATORS
Less than (<) — returns true if the value on the left is less than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
Greater than (>) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
Less than or equal to (<=) — returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
Greater than or equal to (>=) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
Equal to (===) — returns true if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
Not equal to (!==) — returns true if the value on the left is not equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
## LOGICAL OPERATORS
Comparison operators allow us to assert the equality of a statement with JavaScript. For example, we can assert whether two values or expressions are equal with ===, or, whether one value is greater than another with >.

There are scenarios, however, in which we must assert whether multiple values or expressions are true. In JavaScript, we can use logical operators to make these assertions.

&& (and) — This operator will be truthy (act like true) if and only if the expressions on both sides of it are true.
|| (or) — This operator will be truthy if the expression on either side of it is true. Otherwise, it will be falsy (act like false).
### The While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Comparing For and While
If you have read the previous chapter, about the for loop, you will discover that a while loop is much the same as a for loop, with statement 1 and statement 3 omitted.

The loop in this example uses a for loop to collect the car names from the cars array:
