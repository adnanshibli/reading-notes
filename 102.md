## verion control

in this thing we can control on the revious version of the folder and we can get revet to the previous edit in the file or the project so we can easliy control on our mistakes

### Centralized Version Control
The need for developers' cooperation led to the emergence of this system.
However, this system requires a single server that stores all data, changes, and file versions
This system allowed developers and programmers to obtain information about the activities of team members
### Distributed Version Control
This system allows to prevent catastrophic loss of data and files by allowing easy backup copies of data on the server to replace any lost information.
# So, what is Git?
first of all the **snap shot**
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

it also help to follow every changes apllied on folders and git will find also the corruption or loss of information in transit.

## saving changes
All files in a checked out (or working) copy of a project file are either in a tracked or untracked state.

**Tracked**

Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged they were part of the most recent file snapshot.

**Untracked**

Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.

After cloning a repository files have tracked status and are unmodified because they have been checked out but not edited.
