## About computers work
**what make the computer a computer**
when they have invint the computer
they think it must have:
* input
* storage
* prossesing
* out put
and that is what make the computer a *computer*
at the bignieng the computer start as a calculater
but now the computer is so deffrint
and also it still doing the same
* input
  * that the things what you add to make the computer do something
* storage
  * all the input go to the meomoty of the computer
* prossesing
  * the computer take the input from the meomory and transfer it
* out put
  * computer show output by text , photos,videos  and many thing

**how computer work**
As you can read in our long article on computer history, the first computers were gigantic calculating machines and all they ever really did was "crunch numbers": solve lengthy, difficult, or tedious mathematical problems. Today, computers work on a much wider variety of problems—but they are all still, essentially, calculations. Everything a computer does, from helping you to edit a photograph you've taken with a digital camera to displaying a web page, involves manipulating numbers in one way or another.

Suppose you're back in the late 1970s, before off-the-shelf computer programs have really been invented. You want to program your computer to work as a word processor so you can bash out your first novel—which is relatively easy but will take you a few days of work. A few weeks later, you tire of writing things and decide to reprogram your machine so it'll play chess. Later still, you decide to program it to store your photo collection. Every one of these programs does different things, but they also do quite a lot of similar things too. For example, they all need to be able to read the keys pressed down on the keyboard, store things in memory and retrieve them, and display characters (or pictures) on the screen. If you were writing lots of different programs, you'd find yourself writing the same bits of programming to do these same basic operations every time. That's a bit of a programming chore, so why not simply collect together all the bits of program that do these basic functions and reuse them each time?
