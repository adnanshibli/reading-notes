## intro to script
You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example:
• Select the text inside all of the
elements on a page
• Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of email
MODIFY CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. For example:
• Add a paragraph of text after the
first  h1 element
• Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
• Change the size or position of an element 

*To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks t need to be completed in order to achive*

## Expressions & Operators
***expressions***
* EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
* EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
***operators***
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 
This example demonstrates how
mathematical operators are used
with numbers to calculate the
combined values of two costs.
The first couple of lines create
two variables: one to store the
subtotal of the order, the other
to hold the cost of shipping
the order; so the variables are
named accordingly: subtotal
and shipping.
On the third line, the total is
calculated by adding together
these two values.
This demonstrates how the
mathematical operators can
use variables that represent
numbers. (That is, the numbers
do not need to be written
explicitly into the code.)
The remaining six lines of code
write the results to the screen. 

**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)

Function Invocation
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)
You will learn a lot more about function invocation later in this tutorial.
